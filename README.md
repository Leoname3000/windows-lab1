# windows-lab1
Windows Lab 1 is the first lab work for Windows Apps Development course at Lobach Uni <3  
The goals are:
- Create main form with list of people (described with Name, Card Number and Birthday)
- Create a modal form for editing people's data
- Create a non-modal form for logging in as a user/admin
- Make admin be able to change people's otherwise unchangeable data fields
- Make 'Apply' button escape the mouse if the 'Card Number' field is changed
